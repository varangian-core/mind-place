# ðŸŒ€ MindPlace Snippet Manager

**MindPlace Snippet Manager** is a powerful, pastebin-like platform designed to help you create, manage, and share code snippets with rich Markdown formatting. It seamlessly integrates with Google Drive for storage and leverages a Postgres database for managing snippet metadata. With a polished UI built on Next.js 13 (App Router), Material UI, Tailwind CSS, and Prisma, youâ€™ll enjoy a delightful and themeable coding experience.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Theming Options:**  
  Choose from **Light**, **Dark**, or **Synthwave** modes, directly from the sidebar. Instantly transform your interfaceâ€™s look and feel.

- **Rich Markdown Support:**  
  Write snippets using full Markdown, including:
  - **Headings**, **bold**, *italic*, ***bold+italic*** text
  - [Links](https://example.com), images, blockquotes, and tables
  - Code blocks with syntax highlighting for multiple languages (e.g., ` ```java `, ` ```python `)
  
- **Enhanced Snippet Preview:**  
  Toggle between editing Markdown and previewing rendered HTML with syntax highlighting. Tables, code blocks, blockquotes, and images all look great.

- **Integrated Storage & Metadata:**  
  Store snippet files in Google Drive (optional) and maintain metadata (name, content, created date) in Postgres via Prisma.  
  Each snippet gets a unique URL: `/gist/{id}` for easy sharing.

  Enjoy a professional UI with gradients, animated SVG backgrounds, and rounded corners. The MUI DataGrid lists snippets with:
  - Name, URL link icon (opens in new tab)

  - Icon indicating Drive storage
